                Another interesting question we wanted to give answer to is which politicians are prone to fast forget
                issues related to our topic. <br> For this type of analysis, we will consider only politicians with most
                quotes about climate change (Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, etc.), since they are the most
                representative individuals.

                Firtsly, let's consider former presidents, Barack Obama and Donald Trump.

                Note one interesting thing - Barack Obama said the most climate change related quotes
                in the period before the year 2017, while Donald Trump became more cited in the year 2017 and onwards.
                <br>
                As you probably know, 2016-2017 is the period of changes in which Barack Obama finished his carrer as US
                president, and Donald Trump began his. Could this be a confounder, i.e. Barack Obama became irrelevant
                after the end of his career (and vice-versa
                for Donald Trump)? Recall that in linear regression analysis, we noted importance of media relevant
                features.
                <br><br>
                Let's take another speakers, important figures but who were not elected as US presidents during their
                careers. Ideal one are Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

                Bernie Sanders mostly talked about issue of climate change in two periods: end of the year 2015 and end
                of the year 2019. Those are the periods of his presidential campaigns. But did he magically become more
                aware of climate change problems during this periods? Or is there another explanation? <br>
                Let's see the situation in case of Hillary Clinton.

                Interesting, trend of awareness of climate change problems is also emphasized here in the period of
                political campaigns.
                <br><br>
                So, now we became more suspicious in the fact that politicians abuse this global issue, so they could
                gain on a popularity needed in the elections process.
