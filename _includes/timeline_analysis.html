                For our timeline analysis let's consider former presidents, Barack Obama and Donald Trump - at the same
                time, they are also the most quoted politicians in regards to climate change.

                Note one interesting thing - Barack Obama said the most climate change related quotes
                in the period before the year 2017, while Donald Trump became more cited in the year 2017 and onwards.
                <br>
                As you probably know, 2016-2017 is the period of changes in which Barack Obama finished his carrer as US
                president, and Donald Trump began his. Could this be a confounder, i.e. Barack Obama became irrelevant
                after the end of his career (and vice-versa
                for Donald Trump)? Recall that in linear regression analysis, we noted importance of media relevant
                features.
                <br><br>
                Let's take another speaker, important figure but who was not elected as US president during his career.
                Ideal one is Bernie Sanders.

                Bernie Sanders mostly talked about this issue in two periods: end of the year 2015 and end of the year
                2019. Those are the periods of his presidential campaings. But did he magically become more aware of
                climate change problems during this periods? Or is there another explanation? <br>
                Let's see what is the proportion of climate change related quotes with respect to all quotes he said on
                different periods of time.

                Note how peeks from observed periods magically 'vanished'. So, Bernie Sanders did not become more aware
                (percentage of climate change related quotes does not change drastically throughout his career) during
                those periods, but he was just more cited by the media. There is only one outlier in the january of
                2015, which could be interesting to investigate. <br><br>

                Does this stands for Barack Obama and Donald Trump also?
