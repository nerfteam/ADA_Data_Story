          At the first glance, the male gender has more climate change related quotes and a bigger total number of
          quotes than
          the females. However, when comparing the ratio of <em>climate_change_quotes / all_quotes</em> for both men
          (ratio = 0.79%) and women (ratio = 0.95%)
          it seems as if the women are more aware of this global problem.

          The visual representatinon of the age analysis with added gender dimensionality for climate change quotes
          (i.e. the second plot), as
          well as the <em>mean</em> values, are similar - we could ask ourselves if these
          two distributions are coming from a same underlying distribution. Since the std values are similar, we can
          apply the ttest.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          After getting a p-value = 1.79e-05 (which is less than ordinary 0.01), we can conclude that the difference in
          the mean values is significant, therefore these two distributions most likely come from two different
          distributions - where the mean for females is a bit lower than the one for males.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          This could lead us to the conclusion that older female politicians talk less about climate change than their
          male colleagues.
          However, taking the first plot into the account, we can observe a much bigger number of older male politicians
          than female - making the older female politicians, to some extent, underrepresented.

          We have observed some interesting statistics, but is it relevant to our problem? <br>
          Recall that our analysis should be based on different political and demographic parameters of speakers. So,
          let's see which of aforementioned parameters really matter. <br>

          The main goal of the linear regression is to determine the impact given parameters have on the number of

          When it comes to features, we will feed the linear regression with following ones:
          degree_num, age, party_name, gender_name,
          was_presidental_candidate, was_in_congres, party_count, was_president,

        <div class="text-justify lead">
          Based on the results of linear regression we can conclude:
          <li>Features <em>age</em> and <em>gender</em> have p-values bigger than 0.05, and therefore do
            not have significant
            influence on outcome, i.e. on the number of quotations regarding climate change. </li>
          <li>Political features (<em>was_candidate, was_in_congres, was_president, party_count, party_name</em>) have
            significant impact on outcome.</li>
          <li>Number of degrees have significant impact on outcome.</li>
          <li>Features <em>numOccurrences, totalNumOccurrences, total_num_quotes</em>, which are more media related,
            have
            significant impact on outcome.</li>

        <br>

        <p class="text-justify lead">
          If you have been reading carefully (don't worry we won't judge if you haven't) you certainly remember that
          during gender analysis we observed
          that women talk more about climate change than men, relatively speaking (comparing
          climate_change_quotes/all_quotes ratios). Surprisingly,
          linear regression is not gender biased - the gender feature is irrelevant.
          This must mean that another feature is the influential one, and that the gender feature is just masking it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify lead">
          We have a strong hunch that this <em>mystical</em> feature is none other than the party name (which indeed is
          a significant feature).
          <br>
          Let's take a closer look at some more (you guessed it) charts.

        <p class="text-justify lead">
          Clearly, the proportion of women is much bigger in the Democratic party - there are almost twice as much women
          in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party. Hence, it is not the gender that's
          dominating, but simply the party.
        </p>
        <br> <br>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          Note the R<sup>2</sup> coefficient, it is 0.949, which means that we have explained most of the variance. But
          this observation is not of a importance if residuals are not zero-centered. Let's check that.

          important?
