          At the first glance, the male gender has more climate change related quotes and a bigger total number of
          quotes than
          the females. However, when comparing the ratio of <em>climate_change_quotes / all_quotes</em> for both men
          (ratio = 0.79%) and women (ratio = 0.95%)
          it seems as if the women are more aware of this global problem.

          So, we can see that number of quotes with respect to age parameter follows a Gaussian-like distribution, with
          small
          anomalies. <br>
          Now, let's see if the age structure changes when we add the aforementioned gender dimensionality.

          The visual representation of the age analysis with added gender dimensionality for climate change quotes
          (i.e. the second plot), as
          well as the <em>mean</em> values, are similar - we could ask ourselves if these
          two distributions are coming from the same underlying distribution. Since the std values are similar, we can
          apply the ttest.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          After getting a p-value = 1.79e-05 (which is less than the ordinary 0.01), we can conclude that the difference in
          the mean values is significant, therefore these two distributions most likely come from two different
          distributions - where the mean for females is a bit lower than the one for males.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          This could lead us to the conclusion that older female politicians talk less about climate change than their
          male colleagues.
          However, taking the first plot into the account, we can observe a much bigger number of older male politicians
          than females - making the older female politicians, to some extent, underrepresented.

          The inspection of these pie charts unfolds some peculiar things. The Democratic party, although having fewer
          quotes in total, has a bigger number of quotes related to climate change. Does it mean that Democrats
          are more conscious?
          <br>On the other hand, ratio values (i.e. <em>climate_change_quotes / all_quotes</em>) are very small, so it
          may lead us to believe that political affiliation is
