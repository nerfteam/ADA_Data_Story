            Okay, that's enough of analysing the isolated parameters. We have observed some interesting statistics, but
            is it relevant to our problem? <br>
            Recall that our analysis should be based on different political and demographic parameters of speakers. So,
            let's see which of the aforementioned parameters really matter. As Robert West would say, 'Linear regression
            gives us free p-values'. So why shouldn't we take advantage of this present?

            We are trying to predict the number of <strong>climate change related quotes</strong> attributed to a single
            person. The
            features related to a person used for this regression analysis can be divided into 5 categories:

            The model achieved an astonishing R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.949 implying that we explained almost all of the

            Moreover, the p-values of all features except the demographic ones entail significance. This is unexpected,
            linear
            regression proved to not be gender biased. As we have seen before women are more inclined to talk about
            climate change, so how is this possible?

        <p class="text-justify lead">
            This must mean that another feature is the influential one, and that the gender feature is just masking it.
            We have a strong hunch that this mystical feature is none other than the party name (which indeed is a
            significant feature).
            Let's take a closer look at some more charts.

            Clearly, the proportion of women is much bigger in the Democratic party - there are almost twice as much
            women in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party. Hence, it is not the gender that's dominating,
            but simply the party.
