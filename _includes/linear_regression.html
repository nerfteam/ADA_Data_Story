                Okay, that's enough of analysing the isolated parameters.
                We have observed some interesting statistics, but is it relevant to our problem? <br>
                Recall that our analysis should be based on different political and demographic parameters of speakers.
                So,
                let's see which of aforementioned parameters really matter. <br>
                As Bob West would say, 'Linear regression gives us free p-values'. So why would not we utilize this
                present.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
                The main goal of the linear regression is to determine the impact given parameters have on the number of
                climate change quotes (i.e the outcome is the number of climate change related quotes).
                <br>
                When it comes to features, we will feed the linear regression with following ones:
                degree_num, age, party_name, gender_name,
                was_presidental_candidate, was_in_congres, party_count, was_president,
                numOccurrences, totalNumOccurrences, total_num_quotes.

                Based on the results of linear regression we can conclude:
                <li>Features <em>age</em> and <em>gender</em> have p-values bigger than 0.05, and therefore do
                    not have significant
                    influence on outcome, i.e. on the number of quotations regarding climate change. </li>
                <li>Political features (<em>was_candidate, was_in_congres, was_president, party_count, party_name</em>)
                    have
                    significant impact on outcome.</li>
                <li>Number of degrees have significant impact on outcome.</li>
                <li>Features <em>numOccurrences, totalNumOccurrences, total_num_quotes</em>, which are more media
                    related,
                    have
                    significant impact on outcome.</li>
            </div>
            <br>

            <p class="text-justify lead">
                If you have been reading carefully (don't worry we won't judge if you haven't) you certainly remember
                that
                during gender analysis we observed
                that women talk more about climate change than men, relatively speaking (comparing
                climate_change_quotes/all_quotes ratios). Surprisingly,
                linear regression is not gender biased - the gender feature is irrelevant.
                This must mean that another feature is the influential one, and that the gender feature is just masking
                it.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify lead">
                We have a strong hunch that this <em>mystical</em> feature is none other than the party name (which
                indeed
                is
                a significant feature).
                <br>
                Let's take a closer look at some more (you guessed it) charts.

                Clearly, the proportion of women is much bigger in the Democratic party - there are almost twice as much
                women
                in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party. Hence, it is not the gender that's
                dominating, but simply the party.

            <p class="text-justify lead">
                Note the R<sup>2</sup> coefficient, it is 0.949, which means that we have explained most of the
                variance.
                But
                this observation is not of a importance if residuals are not zero-centered. Let's check that.

                Thank God the residuals are mean centered! We can conclude that R<sup>2</sup> measure is relevant. <br>
                So this tell us that we have three groups of features which are significant, but which ones are the most
                important?
